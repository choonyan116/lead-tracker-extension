# lead-tracker-extension
I have created a browser extension that can be used to track lead/webpage URLs using JavaScript which have the following functionality: 
- Save the URLs from the input. 
- Save the URLs directly from the active tab. 
- Delete all the URLs saved in the extension. 
- Saved URLs will not disappear after the user closed the browser. 
- Save the URLs in txt file.
